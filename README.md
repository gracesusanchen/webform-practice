# Webform to find Meetups using Zipcode

# Getting Started

* Navigate to the root folder and run `npm install`
* Run `gulp`, and start editing the main script

# TODO

* Add eslint gulp task
* Only tested in Safari. Fix CORS error (as seen in Chrome) by hosting the page locally, and adding the server start method gulp.
* Once done, can move API key onto server config.
* Write a nightwatch test for loading the index.html, and enter test zipcodes, and checking the rendered results.
